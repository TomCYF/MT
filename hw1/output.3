honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a committee for determining qualified was achievement . 
yesterday I attended on the first meeting of this committee . 
and I surprised to what the committee admits that it does knew too what to do with those senators independent . 
what will not strike so much for the time . 
the members of the Committee for determining qualified can be a certain impact . 
on the business which reshape a senator within the next two years . 
this is a committee important , because , in principle , these nine senators determine at what committee sit some senators . 
I am therefore introduced in the sitting of a committee that yesterday for see that a of the nine senators not attend . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I do name person . 
you can see now to how i am friendly , would it not ? 
those senators will make their own research to find who was on fault . 
when an individual accept an outstanding job , it must the do . 
the women who sit on the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient their duty much better than what the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the sessions that held the to the committee of veterans in February 1998 . 
Ni the Senate or the House of Commons do not sitting at that stage . 
three senators Liberals saw to proceedings of the committee , all of women . 
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to this committee . 
i could cite , word by word , what the hon. senator Carstairs it replied to the question I asked . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it has stated that she was the first to deal with the question of the representation of women in a report . 
that what it did was drafted on the parliamentary associations in 1993 . 
Les delegations to the day were formées only of men . 
on this matter , this is I been replaced by the senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I look still the opportunity to re - enter my association preferred . 
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will a ruling in regard of these two reports . 
each time that those senators are verdict on television . 
or wondered by a group of students , to journalists or any . 
that say we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , that should being translated in fact . 
i do not think in the replacing . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he or is she should participate to all the meetings provided . 
we are not of members which the words in the corridors : 
" Présentez do you to committee today and , after two years of student , there will a vote final in committee '' . 
they do not even know what they are viewed , but they sang came to when their leadership sang to them . 
they do not know absolutely not what has happened . 
honourable senators , the words " continuité " and " dedication '' , come in the way in our speech . 
in the two coming weeks and starting to reflect on the way we will address the situation from senators independent . 
if we do the are not , I créerai my own committee of parliamentarians who are concerned about with international affairs . 
no one can we are gained . 
his Honour the Speaker : 
if any other hon. senator do wishes to speak , you is it the pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , and the report agreed . )
