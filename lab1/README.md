# Lab 1 setup

We use Anaconda + Python 3.5 for this lab. This is a short guide on installing software on DICE machines. For other OS, refer to [Anaconda page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

### Download Anaconda
Open a terminal on the DICE machine and then type the following command:
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Set up a virtual environment and install packages
Clone the lab github repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/INFR11133/lab1.git
cd lab1
```

Create and install packages by entering the command:
```
conda create --name lab1
source activate lab1
conda install seaborn pandas jupyter matplotlib  
```

Start the notebook by entering the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Read through the *IBM Model1* notebook. The *animation* notebook contains the code used to create the animated parameter change visualizations, and is not part of the lab. You may use it if you wish to create your own animations.
